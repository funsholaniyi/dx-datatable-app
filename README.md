* Use any public API or make own to load JSON with 5000+ records;
* Use vanilla js or Vue.js framework to implement data representation table (at least 3 columns);
* Click on any column header it should sort the table by a particular column, next click should reverse order;
* Add pagination. Leave the possibility to see all records ant one;
* Output last clicked table cell data somewhere on the screen outside table. Change the color of last clicked row;
* Have a strong concern about performance;
* Commit source to a public repository (GitHub) and send the link;
* Would be great to have a live demo online.
